                <p class=" h4 ro">Reverse Osmosis (RO) System</p>
                <p class="te">RO or Reverse Osmosis is the best hyper filtration technique which clarifies the brackish water by removing the salt, fluids, discharge, dissolvable solvents, dyes, bacteria and other harmful constituents. Our RO plants make sure that the natural nutrients are adequate to maintain the health level of water. We design customized solutions which are suitable for marine applications to purify a large amount of water at once with high-performance capacity. Not only the industrial and manufacturing units, but also municipalities can be facilitated with the customized RO plants.</p>

                <p class=" h4 effluent"> Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP)</p>
                <p class="te"> Basically Four types of methods are used	Effluent &
                    waste-water treatment, We are having promising technologies
                    to treat wastewater generated from various industries containing
                    highly organic, inorganic, oil & grease, heavy metals
                    and suspended solids. Based on the effluent parameters
                    as per nature & compositions. We design steady state
                    model to overcome environmental issues related
                    to industry.
                    The processes involved for the treatment of various effluents are anaerobic (UASBR, Anaerobic flter, biodigestor), aerobic (diffused aeration), hybrid (anaerobic+aerobic).
